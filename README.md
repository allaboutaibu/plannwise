### Project Description
PlanWise is a structured, emotion-aware study planner designed to help students manage their time effectively without feeling overwhelmed. The application generates balanced daily timetables based on the user’s mood, subject difficulty, and available study hours.
It also includes a customizable Pomodoro timer that allows users to set their own focus and break durations, promoting healthy study habits and preventing burnout.
The goal of PlanWise is to combine intelligent planning with calm, distraction-free design — helping students study smarter, stay consistent, and maintain focus in a structured way.

### The Problem statement
Students often struggle to create effective study schedules that match their energy levels, mood, and subject difficulty. Traditional timetables are rigid and fail to adapt to changing workloads or mental states.
This leads to unrealistic planning, poor time management, reduced focus, and eventually burnout.
There is a need for a smart, structured, and adaptive study planning system that helps students balance subjects, manage focus sessions, and maintain productivity without overwhelming themselves.

### The Solution
To address the problem of unstructured and unrealistic study planning, PlanWise provides a smart, adaptive study planning system that generates balanced timetables based on a student’s mood, subject difficulty, and available study time.
The system intelligently distributes study sessions to avoid overload and ensures that difficult subjects are scheduled strategically. It also integrates a customizable Pomodoro timer, allowing students to manage focus and break durations according to their personal preferences.
By combining structured planning with controlled focus sessions, PlanWise helps students maintain productivity, reduce burnout, and develop consistent study habits in a calm and organized environment.
